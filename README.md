# Surveillance Robot for Rescue Mission 🤖🚨

A B.Tech ECE major project developed by final-year students at Nehru College of Engineering. This robot is designed to assist in real-time disaster rescue operations by navigating hazardous environments, detecting survivors, and transmitting vital information back to rescuers.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This ESP32-based wireless surveillance robot is engineered to:

- Remotely navigate disaster zones using joystick controls.
- Stream real-time video and thermal imaging.
- Detect water levels, temperature, and human presence via sensors.
- Communicate with victims and deliver essential supplies like water or medical kits.
- Operate with minimal internet dependency using ESP-NOW protocol.

## 📦 Key Components

- **ESP32 & ESP8266** – Microcontroller units with Wi-Fi capabilities.
- **ESP32-CAM** – Live video streaming.
- **Thermal Camera (AMG8833)** – Heat-based human detection.
- **Water Level & DHT11 Sensors** – Environmental data collection.
- **L298N Motor Driver & DC Motors** – Movement control.
- **MP3 Module & Speaker** – Voice alerts and communication.
- **Lithium-Ion Battery** – Power supply.
- **Carrier** – Delivery mechanism for essentials.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Embedded C** – For robot control and sensor integration.
- **ESP-NOW Communication Protocol** – Low-latency peer-to-peer wireless data transfer.
- **TCP/IP Socket Communication** – For video and sensor data exchange.
- **IoT** – For remote monitoring and control.

## 📈 Achievements

- Reliable wireless robot control using ESP-NOW.
- Stable real-time video and sensor data transmission.
- Effective thermal-based survivor detection.
- Functional prototype capable of navigating and assisting in rescue scenarios.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- AI-based decision-making and navigation (SLAM).
- Integration of gas and parametric pressure sensors.
- Swarm robotics for multi-bot rescue systems.
- Solar-powered energy systems for extended missions.
